Assessment**: 90% (Foundation is solid, key integrations and analytics features
require completion)

---

## üéØ **VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION GAPS**

### **HIGH PRIORITY - MVP BLOCKERS**

#### 1. Analytics & Hypothesis Validation Loop (Data Model & Integration)

**Current Compliance**: 60% (Foundational tables exist, but the event-level
tracking loop is incomplete) **Source**:
`front end structure /implementation/DATA_MODEL.md`, `prisma/migrations/`

**‚ùå Missing Components**:

- **`HypothesisValidationEvent` table/logging**: The core entity for tracking
  individual hypothesis validation events is not yet implemented in the database
  schema.
- **Specific Analytics Event Logging**: The application is not yet logging
  detailed analytics events (e.g., `ContentSearchAnalytics`,
  `SMEContributionAnalytics`) as defined in `DATA_MODEL.md`.
- **Analytics Dashboards**: The routes and components for viewing hypothesis
  validation (`/analytics/hypothesis-dashboard`) are not implemented.

**‚úÖ Implemented**:

- A strong foundational schema for analytics is in place (`user_story_metrics`,
  `performance_baselines`, `component_traceability`, `test_cases`).
- `component_traceability` is implemented in the frontend, linking components to
  user stories.

#### 2. Advanced Product & Workflow Features (Wireframes & UI)

**Current Compliance**: 75% (Core screens are built, but advanced functionality
is missing) **Wireframe Source**:
`front end structure /wireframes/PRODUCT_RELATIONSHIPS_SCREEN.md`,
`front end structure /wireframes/APPROVAL_WORKFLOW_SCREEN.md`

**‚ùå Missing Components**:

- **Product Relationships**: Proposal simulator, advanced version history, and
  AI-powered pattern detection are not implemented.
- **Approval Workflows**: The template-based configuration system and dynamic
  routing with conditional logic are missing.
- **Predictive Validation**: The `PREDICTIVE_VALIDATION_MODULE.md` is not yet
  implemented.

**‚úÖ Implemented**:

- Basic product relationship visualization and management screens are in place.
- A functional, multi-stage approval process is implemented.

#### 3. Full Backend Integration for Admin Panels (Implementation)

**Current Compliance**: 80% (UI is well-developed, but some areas rely on mock
data) **Source**: `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`

**‚ùå Missing Components**:

- The `RoleManager` and other admin components show signs of using mock data
  (`MOCK_ROLES`), indicating that the UI is ahead of the full backend and
  database integration for role and permission management.

**‚úÖ Implemented**:

- A comprehensive, tab-based admin interface has been built.
- Custom hooks (`useUsers`, `useRoles`) are in place for fetching data.

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY - POST-MVP ENHANCEMENTS**

#### 4. Sitemap vs. Route Implementation Discrepancies

**Current Compliance**: 85% (Most routes exist, but some structural differences
are present) **Source**: `front end structure /implementation/SITEMAP.md`,
`src/app/`

**‚ùå Missing Components**:

- **Admin Section**: Implemented as a single-page, tabbed component rather than
  the granular file-based routes (`/admin/users`, `/admin/roles`) specified in
  the sitemap.
- **Analytics Routes**: Key dashboards like `/analytics/hypothesis-dashboard`
  and `/analytics/performance-baselines` are missing.
- **Miscellaneous Routes**: Several additional feature routes like
  `/notifications`, `/help`, and `/search/global` are not yet implemented.

**‚úÖ Implemented**:

- The majority of core feature routes are implemented using Next.js App Router
  conventions and route groups.

#### 5. Data Model - Advanced Relationships & Models

**Current Compliance**: 75% (Core models are solid, but advanced/predictive
models are missing) **Source**:
`front end structure /implementation/DATA_MODEL.md`

**‚ùå Missing Components**:

- **Predictive Validation**: `PredictiveValidationModel` and `RiskAssessment`
  tables are not in the schema.
- **Advanced Communications**: `NotificationTemplate` and
  `CommunicationPreferences` models are not implemented.
- **Full Accessibility Schema**: The detailed accessibility models
  (`AccessibilityConfiguration`, etc.) are not yet in the database.

**‚úÖ Implemented**:

- Core entities (User, Role, Permission, Proposal, Product, etc.) are fully
  implemented and migrated.
- The foundational analytics and testing schemas are in place.

#### 6. Comprehensive Testing Coverage

**Current Compliance**: 70% (Excellent testing foundation and patterns, but
coverage needs expansion) **Source**:
`src/components/auth/__tests__/LoginForm.integration.test.tsx`

**‚ùå Missing Components**:

- **Unit Test Coverage**: Needs to be expanded across the majority of components
  to reach the 80% target mentioned in documentation.
- **E2E Test Suite**: A comprehensive end-to-end testing suite needs to be built
  out.

**‚úÖ Implemented**:

- A best-practice integration test (`LoginForm.integration.test.tsx`)
  demonstrates a solid pattern using mocking and user-event simulation.
- The database schema includes tables to support detailed test case management.

#### 7. Mobile Responsiveness Optimization for Complex Screens

**Current Compliance**: 70% (Basic responsiveness is good, but complex data
visualizations are not yet optimized)

**‚ùå Missing Components**:

- The product relationship graph and approval workflow visualizations are not
  yet optimized for mobile or touch-based interaction.

**‚úÖ Implemented**:

- Core layouts and authentication screens are fully responsive.

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1.  **Complete Backend Integration for Admin**: Replace all mock data in the
    Admin section with live data from the API and database. This is critical for
    managing users and permissions.
2.  **Implement Analytics Event Logging**: Implement the
    `HypothesisValidationEvent` model and begin logging detailed analytics
    events to close the hypothesis validation loop.
3.  **Build Core Analytics Dashboard**: Create the
    `/analytics/hypothesis-dashboard` to visualize the data being collected and
    validate that the analytics pipeline is working end-to-end.
4.  **Implement Advanced Features for Product/Workflows**: Begin building the
    template-based workflow system and the product relationship simulator, as
    these are identified as MVP blockers.

This gap analysis confirms the implementation is **on a strong trajectory for
the MVP**, with the immediate focus required on completing the analytics data
loop and finishing backend integration for core features.
