- **Solution**: Must be disabled/commented out for Netlify
- **Documentation**: Prominent warnings in all deployment docs

### Issue #3: Missing NextAuth Pages

- **Problem**: References to non-existent error and contact pages
- **Solution**: Implement all referenced pages before deployment
- **Documentation**: Pre-deployment checklists now include page verification

### Issue #4: API Route Architecture

- **Problem**: Conflicting route structures causing failures
- **Solution**: Consistent API routing patterns
- **Documentation**: Best practices for API route organization
