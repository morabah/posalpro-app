# INTEGRATED AI DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive framework for developing applications
using AI-assisted methodologies, based on successful patterns implemented in the
PosalPro MVP2 project. The framework emphasizes wireframe-driven development,
user journeys, and hybrid implementation approaches to accelerate development
while maintaining code quality and scalability.

## Key Principles

1. **Documentation-Driven Development**: Every feature begins with comprehensive
   documentation that serves as both specification and learning repository
2. **Contract-First Development**: Define TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas
   before implementation to ensure type safety across the application
3. **Parallel Track Development**: Implement UI and data layers simultaneously
   using mock data for rapid prototyping
4. **Component Composition**: Build applications using atomic design principles
   with reusable, composable components
5. **AI-Assisted Implementation**: Leverage structured prompts to accelerate
   development with consistent patterns

## Hybrid Development Methodology
