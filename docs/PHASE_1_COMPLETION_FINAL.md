// Verified Pattern Implementation
try {
  // Analytics operation
  return await analyticsOperation();
} catch (error) {
  const processedError = errorHandlingService.processError(
    error,
    'Analytics operation failed',
    ErrorCodes.DATA.QUERY_FAILED,
    {
      component: 'AnalyticsService',
      operation: 'operationName',
      hypothesis: 'H1',
      userFriendlyMessage: 'Analytics data temporarily unavailable',
    }
  );
  throw processedError;
}
```
