Project Context: PosalPro MVP2 - Deadline Management System Implementation (H.7)

Implementation Objective: Create comprehensive deadline management system that improves on-time completion rates by ≥40% through intelligent timeline estimation, critical path analysis, and proactive deadline tracking.

Primary Components to Implement:
1. DeadlineTracker - Central deadline management component
2. TimelineEstimator - AI-powered timeline prediction system
3. CriticalPathAnalyzer - Dependency and bottleneck identification
4. DeadlineNotificationSystem - Proactive alerts and escalation
5. PerformanceAnalytics - H7 hypothesis validation tracking

User Story Requirements:
- US-4.1: Intelligent timeline creation with complexity-based estimates
- US-4.3: Intelligent task prioritization with dependency mapping

Acceptance Criteria Implementation:
- AC-4.1.1: Timeline based on complexity → complexityEstimation() method
- AC-4.1.2: Critical path identification → criticalPath() method
- AC-4.1.3: ≥40% on-time completion improvement → performance tracking
- AC-4.3.1: Priority algorithms → calculatePriority() method
- AC-4.3.2: Dependency mapping → mapDependencies() method
- AC-4.3.3: Progress tracking → trackProgress() method

Component Traceability Matrix:
```typescript
const H7_COMPONENT_MAPPING = {
  userStories: ['US-4.1', 'US-4.3'],
  acceptanceCriteria: ['AC-4.1.1', 'AC-4.1.2', 'AC-4.1.3', 'AC-4.3.1', 'AC-4.3.2', 'AC-4.3.3'],
  methods: [
    'complexityEstimation()',
    'criticalPath()',
    'calculatePriority()',
    'mapDependencies()',
    'trackProgress()',
    'trackDeadlinePerformance()'
  ],
  hypotheses: ['H7'],
  testCases: ['TC-H7-001', 'TC-H7-002']
};

Analytics Requirements:

- Track baseline completion times before implementation
- Measure timeline estimation accuracy
- Monitor critical path prediction effectiveness
- Track on-time completion rate improvements
- Validate ≥40% improvement target achievement

Implementation Deliverables:

1. DeadlineTracker component with full CRUD operations

5. useDeadlineManagementAnalytics hook for H7 validation
6. Integration with existing dashboard and proposal systems
7. Comprehensive test coverage for TC-H7-001, TC-H7-002
8. Performance improvement documentation

Technical Requirements:

- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- React Hook Form integration for deadline editing
- Zod validation schemas for deadline data
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Real-time updates with optimistic UI
- Mobile-responsive design
- Performance optimization (<200ms interactions)

Quality Gates:
