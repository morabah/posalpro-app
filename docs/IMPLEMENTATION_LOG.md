### Key Implementation Decisions

- Focused on information architecture and layout patterns rather than visual
  design
- Created multiple layout variations (table-based, card-based, split-panel) to
  explore different UX approaches
- Ensured all wireframes align with implemented UI components (Button,
  DropdownMenu, NavigationMenu, etc.)
- Incorporated role-based considerations across all screens
- Maintained responsive design principles with dedicated mobile wireframes
- Added detailed notes for implementation guidance
- Explored progressive disclosure patterns for complex interfaces

**Testing**: Wireframes aligned with existing UI component implementations and
follow consistent navigation patterns.

**Notes**: These low-fidelity wireframes serve as the foundation for the UI
development phase, enabling quick iteration on layout and interaction patterns
before committing to detailed visual designs. They follow our
documentation-driven development approach and incorporate user-centered design
principles throughout.
