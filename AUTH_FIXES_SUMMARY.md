# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Issues Resolved

1. **AuthProvider Export Issues**
   - Fixed duplicate AuthContextState interface
   - Properly exported AuthContext and AuthContextState
   - Removed conflicting export statements

2. **useAuth Hook Issues**
   - Restored missing implementation
   - Fixed import path to use '@/hooks/auth/useAuth'
   - Added proper error handling when used outside AuthProvider

3. **Client-Side Execution Guards**
   - Added isClient state management
   - Protected all analytics calls with client-side checks
   - Ensured useEffect hooks only run on client side

4. **Analytics Migration**
   - Replaced legacy analytics.track calls with trackOptimized
   - Added proper priority levels for events
   - Included timestamps for all analytics events

## Verification

✅ AuthProvider compiles without errors
✅ useAuth hook properly consumes AuthContext
✅ Development server runs successfully
✅ Authentication flow works in browser
✅ Dashboard loads correctly after login
✅ Analytics events are properly tracked

## Remaining Items

⚠️ Some lint warnings need attention (non-critical)
⚠️ TypeScript path resolution issues when running tsc directly (expected in single file mode)
