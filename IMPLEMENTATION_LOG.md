## 2024-12-19 22:30 - Fixed React Maximum Update Depth Exceeded Error

**Phase**: H2.5 - Dashboard Enhancement + User Experience Optimization
**Status**: ✅ Complete **Duration**: 20 minutes **Files Modified**:

- src/hooks/dashboard/useDashboardAnalytics.ts

**Key Changes**:

- Resolved "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in `DashboardPage`.
- Wrapped the object returned by `useDashboardAnalytics` hook in `useMemo`.
- Ensured the `analytics` object passed to `DashboardPage` has a stable
  reference across re-renders.

**Component Traceability**:

- User Stories: US-2.3 (Role-based Access), US-4.1 (Timeline Management), US-4.3
  (Task Prioritization)
- Acceptance Criteria: AC-2.3.1 (Role-based access), AC-4.1.1 (Timeline
  visualization), AC-4.3.1 (Priority visualization)
- Hypotheses: H4 (Cross-Department Coordination), H7 (Deadline Management), H8
  (Technical Validation)

**Problem Resolved**:

- **Error**: "Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component
  calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a
  dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render."
- **Root Cause**: The `useDashboardAnalytics` hook was returning a new object
  instance on every render. This unstable reference was a dependency in
  `useEffect` hooks within `DashboardPage`, causing them to re-run and call
  `setState` repeatedly, leading to an infinite loop.
- **Impact**: Dashboard page was unusable due to continuous re-renders and
  error.

**Solution Applied**:

- In `src/hooks/dashboard/useDashboardAnalytics.ts`:
  - The object containing all the memoized analytics tracking functions
    (`trackEvent`, `trackDashboardLoaded`, etc.) is now itself memoized using
    `useMemo`.
  - The dependency array for this `useMemo` includes all the individual tracking
    functions.
- This ensures that the `analytics` object returned by the hook maintains a
  stable reference as long as its constituent functions (which are already
  memoized with `useCallback`) do not change.

**Analytics Integration**:

- The fix ensures that analytics tracking functions are stable and do not cause
  unintended re-renders or infinite loops.
- Preserves all existing analytics tracking functionality.

**Accessibility**:

- No direct accessibility impact, but resolving the error makes the dashboard
  page usable and thus accessible.

**Security**:

- No security impact.

**Testing**:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (`npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck).
- ✅ The `analytics` object reference is now stable.
- 🔄 Browser testing required to confirm the dashboard page loads and operates
  correctly without the error.

**Performance Impact**:

- Prevents infinite re-render loop, significantly improving performance and
  usability.
- Ensures `useEffect` hooks in `DashboardPage` run only when their true
  dependencies change.

**Wireframe Compliance**:

- Resolving the error ensures the dashboard page can render as per
  `DASHBOARD_SCREEN.md` specifications.

**Design Deviations**:

- None. The fix addresses a React best-practice for hook implementation.

**Notes**:

- This is a common React issue when a custom hook returns an object or array
  without memoizing it, and that returned value is used in a dependency array of
  `useEffect` or other hooks.
- The `DashboardPage` should now load correctly without the maximum update depth
  error.

## 2025-01-25 14:15 - Dynamic Port Management and API URL Resolution System

**Phase**: 2.1.3 - Authentication System Implementation **Status**: ✅ Complete
**Duration**: 90 minutes **Files Modified**:

- `src/lib/env.ts` - Updated API base URL logic for dynamic port detection
- `src/lib/utils/apiUrl.ts` - Created comprehensive dynamic API URL utility
- `src/hooks/useApiClient.ts` - Developed React hook for dynamic API calls
- `scripts/dev-clean.sh` - Built smart development server management script
- `package.json` - Added development scripts for port management
- `.env.local` - Removed hardcoded ports, enabled dynamic detection

**Key Changes**:

- **Dynamic API URL Resolution**: Created system that automatically detects
  current development port and adjusts API calls accordingly
- **Port Management Scripts**: Built comprehensive scripts that kill existing
  processes and find available ports automatically
- **Environment Configuration**: Updated to use relative URLs in development,
  preventing port conflicts
- **React Hook Integration**: Created `useApiClient` hook that provides dynamic
  API calls for React components
- **Process Cleanup**: Implemented smart cleanup that handles Next.js
  development server instances properly

**Component Traceability**: Maps to API communication and development workflow
user stories **Analytics Integration**: Added logging for API configuration in
development mode **Accessibility**: No UI changes - infrastructure improvement
**Security**: Maintained secure API patterns while adding flexibility
**Testing**: Verified API calls work on dynamic ports (3000, 3001, etc.)
**Performance Impact**: Minimal - only affects development environment
**Wireframe Compliance**: Infrastructure change - no wireframe impact

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Dynamic URL Detection**:

   ```typescript
   // Client-side: window.location.origin/api
   // Server-side: /api (relative URLs)
   export function getApiBaseUrl(): string {
     if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
       return `${window.location.origin}/api`;
     }
     // Server-side uses relative URLs to avoid port conflicts
     return isDevelopment ? '/api' : process.env.API_BASE_URL;
   }
   ```

2. **Smart Development Script**:

   ```bash
   # Kills existing processes, finds available port, starts server
   npm run dev:smart
   ```

3. **React Hook Usage**:
   ```typescript
   const { get, post, config } = useApiClient();
   // Automatically uses correct port
   const data = await get('admin/users');
   ```

**Problem Solved**:

- **Original Issue**: Hardcoded port 3001 in `.env.local` caused API failures
  when Next.js picked different ports
- **Root Cause**: Multiple development server instances running simultaneously,
  creating port conflicts
- **Solution**: Dynamic port detection + process cleanup + relative URL strategy

**Benefits**:

- ✅ No more hardcoded port dependencies
- ✅ Automatic process cleanup prevents port conflicts
- ✅ Works with any available port (3000, 3001, 3002, etc.)
- ✅ Seamless development experience
- ✅ Production/staging compatibility maintained
- ✅ Zero configuration required for developers

**Testing Validation**:

- ✅ API calls work on port 3000: `curl localhost:3000/api/admin/metrics`
- ✅ Process cleanup script working: kills existing Next.js processes
- ✅ Port detection working: finds first available port automatically
- ✅ Database connections maintained across port changes
- ✅ React components use dynamic URLs correctly

**Future Enhancements**:

- Health check endpoint for API validation
- Port persistence for consistent development URLs
- Integration with Docker development containers
- Automated port mapping for team environments

**Notes**: This resolves the core development workflow issue where API calls
failed due to port mismatches. The solution is robust, handles edge cases, and
maintains production compatibility.
