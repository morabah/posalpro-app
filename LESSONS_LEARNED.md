## [Build & Deployment] - Resolving Production Build Failures

**Date**: 2024-06-20 **Phase**: 2.3.1 - Proposal Approval Workflow **Context**:
The application was failing to build for a production deployment to Netlify,
encountering a series of ESLint warnings, TypeScript errors, and runtime model
mismatches. **Problem**: Multiple interconnected issues were preventing a
successful build:

1.  **TypeScript Errors**: Test files were being included in the production
    build compilation, causing type conflicts.
2.  **Prisma Model Mismatches**: API routes contained incorrect model names
    (e.g., `executionStage` instead of `WorkflowStage`), leading to runtime
    errors that were caught by the TypeScript compiler.
3.  **Complex Type Errors**: Data transformation logic in API routes was faulty,
    leading to type shape mismatches (e.g., expecting a `Date` object but
    receiving an array).
4.  **Tooling Instability**: The AI-powered file editing tools were
    inconsistent, failing to apply patches correctly and delaying the fix.

**Solution**:

1.  **Isolate Build Issues**: The `next.config.js` file was temporarily modified
    to ignore ESLint and TypeScript errors (`ignoreDuringBuilds: true`), which
    helped separate linting issues from critical compilation errors.
2.  **Schema-Driven Correction**: The `prisma/schema.prisma` file was used as
    the single source of truth to identify and correct the model and field name
    discrepancies in `src/app/api/approvals/route.ts`.
3.  **Targeted Type Fixing**: The logic for handling `dueDate` and related
    fields was completely rewritten to align with the data structures defined in
    the Prisma schema, resolving the complex type errors.
4.  **Manual Code Replacement**: After repeated failures with patching tools,
    the entire problematic file was replaced with a corrected version, ensuring
    all errors were fixed simultaneously.
5.  **Iterative Verification**: After each significant change, `npm run build`
    was executed locally to confirm the fix before moving to the next issue or
    attempting a full deployment.

**Key Insights**:

- **Strict `tsconfig.json` for Builds**: Production build configurations in
  `tsconfig.json` must explicitly exclude test files and other non-essential
  assets to prevent type pollution and compilation errors.
- **Schema as the Source of Truth**: When a disconnect occurs between the
  application code and the database layer, the Prisma schema must be treated as
  the definitive guide. All data-related code must align with it perfectly.
- **Embrace Temporary Flags for Debugging**: Build flags like
  `ignoreDuringBuilds` are powerful diagnostic tools. They help isolate the most
  critical, blocking errors from less severe warnings, allowing for a focused
  debugging process. However, they must be removed after the underlying issues
  are resolved to avoid accumulating technical debt.
- **Verify Tooling Output**: Automated code modification tools can be
  unreliable. It is crucial to verify their output (e.g., by checking the diff)
  and have a fallback strategy, such as manual replacement, when they fail.
- **Local Build is a Prerequisite for Deploy**: Never attempt a platform
  deployment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) until a local production build
  (`npm run build`) completes successfully. This saves significant time and
  debugging effort.
