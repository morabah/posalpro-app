# PosalPro MVP2 - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the technical approach and phased execution strategy for
implementing PosalPro MVP2, based on the enhanced wireframes with comprehensive
user story traceability. The implementation follows our established 11-phase
framework with strict adherence to Next.js 15 App Router patterns, TypeScript
strict mode, and documentation-driven development.

## User Story Traceability Integration

### Enhanced Wireframes with Full Traceability

All wireframes now include comprehensive user story traceability with:

- **User Story IDs**: Direct mapping to specific user stories (US-X.X format)
- **Hypothesis Coverage**: Clear link to validation hypotheses (H1, H3, H4, H6,
  H7, H8)
- **Component Traceability Matrix**: TypeScript interfaces mapping user stories
  to component methods
- **Acceptance Criteria Implementation**: Direct mapping to component method
  implementations
- **Measurement Instrumentation**: Analytics hooks for performance tracking and
  hypothesis validation
- **Testing Scenarios**: Specific test cases for hypothesis validation
  (TC-HX-XXX format)

### Hypothesis Validation Framework

The implementation includes systematic hypothesis validation:

- **H1 (Content Discovery)**: 45% search time reduction target
- **H3 (SME Contribution)**: 50% time reduction target
- **H4 (Cross-Department Coordination)**: 40% effort reduction target
- **H6 (Requirement Extraction)**: 30% completeness improvement target
- **H7 (Deadline Management)**: 40% on-time completion improvement target
- **H8 (Technical Validation)**: 50% error reduction target

### Analytics Instrumentation Requirements

Each enhanced wireframe includes specific analytics hooks:

```typescript
// Example analytics instrumentation pattern
interface ComponentMetrics {
  userStory: string[];
  performanceTargets: Record<string, number>;
  measurementPoints: string[];
  successThresholds: Record<string, number>;
}

const useComponentAnalytics = (
  componentId: string,
  metrics: ComponentMetrics
) => {
  const trackPerformance = (
    action: string,
    duration: number,
    metadata?: any
  ) => {
    analytics.track(`${componentId}_performance`, {
      action,
      duration,
      userStory: metrics.userStory,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      ...metadata,
    });
  };

  const trackHypothesisValidation = (hypothesis: string, result: any) => {
    analytics.track('hypothesis_validation', {
      hypothesis,
      componentId,
      result,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });
  };

  return { trackPerformance, trackHypothesisValidation };
};
```
