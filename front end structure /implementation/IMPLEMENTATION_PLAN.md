## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

1. **Complex Product Relationships**

   - Mitigation: Staged implementation with thorough testing
   - Fallback: Simplified relationship model with progressive enhancement

2. **Advanced RBAC Requirements**

   - Mitigation: Start with core RBAC and add advanced features incrementally
   - Fallback: Configuration-based role definitions with simplified hierarchy

3. **Performance with Complex Validation**

   - Mitigation: Optimize algorithms and implement caching
   - Fallback: Background processing for complex validations

4. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Clear boundaries between core and AI-enhanced functionality
   - Fallback: Rule-based alternatives to AI features

### Contingency Plans

1. **Schedule Slippage**

   - Implement core features first
   - Define clear MVP criteria for each phase
   - Prepare feature prioritization framework

2. **Technical Challenges**
   - Allocate buffer time for complex features
   - Prepare simplified alternatives for challenging components
   - Establish early prototyping for high-risk features

## Next Steps

1. Initialize project structure and repository
2. Set up development environment and tooling
3. Implement authentication and basic navigation
4. Begin development of core UI components
5. Start first phase implementation according to schedule
