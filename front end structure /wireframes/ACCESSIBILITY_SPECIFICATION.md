## Implementation Guidelines

### Semantic HTML Structure

```html
<header role="banner">
  <!-- Global navigation -->
  <nav aria-label="Main Navigation">...</nav>
</header>

<main id="main-content">
  <h1>Page Title</h1>
  <!-- Main content -->

  <section aria-labelledby="section-heading">
    <h2 id="section-heading">Section Title</h2>
    <!-- Section content -->
  </section>
</main>

<aside aria-labelledby="sidebar-heading">
  <h2 id="sidebar-heading">Supplementary Content</h2>
  <!-- Sidebar content -->
</aside>

<footer role="contentinfo">
  <!-- Footer content -->
</footer>
```

### ARIA Patterns for Common Components

#### Modal Dialog

```html
<div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title" aria-modal="true">
  <h2 id="dialog-title">Dialog Title</h2>
  <div><!-- Dialog content --></div>
  <button aria-label="Close dialog">✕</button>
</div>
```

#### Tabbed Interface

```html
<div role="tablist" aria-label="Interface tabs">
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="true" aria-controls="panel-1" id="tab-1">
    Tab 1
  </button>
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="panel-2" id="tab-2">
    Tab 2
  </button>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="panel-1" aria-labelledby="tab-1">
  <!-- Tab 1 content -->
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" id="panel-2" aria-labelledby="tab-2" hidden>
  <!-- Tab 2 content -->
</div>
```

#### Form Error Message

```html
<div>
  <label for="field-name">Field Name</label>
  <input id="field-name" aria-describedby="field-error" aria-invalid="true" />
  <div id="field-error" role="alert">Error message</div>
</div>
```

### Color Contrast Requirements

| Element Type                     | Minimum Contrast |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Normal Text (< 18pt)             | 4.5:1            |
| Large Text (≥ 18pt or 14pt bold) | 3:1              |
| UI Components and Graphics       | 3:1              |
| Focus Indicators                 | 3:1              |
| State Indicators                 | 3:1              |

Our color palette has been tested for these requirements:

- Primary Text (#18181B) on Background (#FFFFFF): 15:1
- Secondary Text (#4B5563) on Background (#FFFFFF): 7.5:1
- Primary Button (#0070F3) with White Text: 4.6:1
- Error State (#EF4444) with White Text: 4.7:1
- Success State (#22C55E) with White Text: 3.9:1
- Links (#0070F3) on White Background: 4.6:1
