## Conclusion

The wireframe review confirms strong consistency and integration across all
PosalPro MVP2 screens. The identified minor inconsistencies are easily
addressable during implementation. The wireframes provide a cohesive foundation
for development, with clear user flows, consistent UI patterns, and well-defined
integration points.

## Recommendations

1. Address the identified consistency issues prior to implementation
2. Create a component library based on the wireframes to ensure development
   consistency
3. Implement the integration opportunities to enhance cross-screen functionality
4. Maintain the established design patterns throughout the development process
5. Conduct usability testing to validate the wireframe flows with actual users
