| Based on your validation patterns, we recommend:|
|                                               |
| 1. New Product Relationship Rule              |
|    When [Security Module = Enterprise]        |
|    REQUIRE [Compliance Add-on]                |
|    Confidence: 93% based on 24 past proposals |
|    [Accept Rule] [Modify] [Decline]           |
|                                               |
| 2. Enhanced Pricing Validation               |
|    When [Discount > 15%] AND [New Customer]   |
|    REQUIRE [Executive Approval]               |
|    Confidence: 88% based on 32 past proposals |
|    [Accept Rule] [Modify] [Decline]           |

## Mobile Responsiveness

The Predictive Validation Module is designed with a mobile-first approach:

1. Risk visualization adapts to smaller screens with simplified charts
2. Touch-friendly controls for all interactive elements
3. Progressive disclosure of complex analytical data
4. Prioritized display of high-risk items and immediate actions
5. Optimized performance for on-the-go validation checks

## Accessibility Considerations

- All charts and visualizations include text alternatives
- Color is never the sole indicator of risk (always paired with icons)
- Screen reader support for all predictive analytics
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- High contrast mode for visualization components

## Advanced RBAC Integration

This module integrates with the existing RBAC system with the following
permission considerations:

- View Predictions: Available to all roles with Validation access
- Apply Auto-Fixes: Restricted to roles with appropriate edit permissions
- Configure Learning: Admin-only permission
- Rule Recommendations: Available to Product Managers and Admins
- Risk Override: Available to Finance Approvers and Legal Reviewers with
  appropriate context

## AI Integration Points

1. **Predictive Analytics**: ML models trained on historical validation patterns
2. **Risk Scoring**: Multi-factor analysis of proposal characteristics and
   validation history
3. **Automated Rule Generation**: AI-suggested validation rules based on
   observed patterns
4. **Fix Recommendation**: Context-aware suggestions for resolving validation
   issues
5. **Learning System**: Continuous improvement based on resolution effectiveness
6. **Cross-Proposal Pattern Detection**: Identifying common issues across
   proposal types
