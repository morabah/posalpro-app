# PosalPro MVP2 - Refined Wireframe Designs

## Overview

This directory contains refined layout sketches for PosalPro's core screens,
building upon the low-fidelity wireframes. These designs include actual text
content, improved visual structure, and state handling to provide a clearer
representation of the final UI.

- Success/Confirmation
- Interactive states (hover, focus, active)

### Accessibility Considerations

- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Interactive elements have appropriate focus states
- Error states communicated by more than just color
- Screen reader text for visual elements
- Keyboard navigation patterns defined

### Responsive Design

- All layouts designed with responsive behavior in mind
- Mobile-specific layouts provided for critical flows
- Adaptive components that reflow based on screen size
- Touch-friendly target sizes for mobile interactions

## Design Consistency Standards

All wireframes follow these standardized patterns to ensure a cohesive user
experience:

### Button Labeling Convention

- All action buttons use consistent verb-noun format (e.g., "Create Product",
  "Export Data")
- Primary actions: "Create X", "Edit X", "Delete X"
- Secondary actions: "Import Data", "Export Data", "Clone X"
- Form actions: "Save Changes", "Save Draft", "Save and Activate", "Cancel"

### Tab Navigation

- Consistent horizontal tab navigation across screens with similar information
  density
- Standard placement below screen header and above content area
- Active tab indication through visual highlighting and accessibility attributes
- Consistent semantic tab naming across related screens (e.g., "Dashboard",
  "Details", "History")

### Status Indicators

- Consistent placement of status indicators relative to content
- Standardized color coding: success (green), warning (amber), error (red), info
  (blue)
- Status indicators include both color and iconography for accessibility
- Consistent naming conventions for statuses across all screens

### Navigation Patterns

- Left sidebar navigation consistent across all authenticated screens
- Breadcrumb navigation for hierarchical content
- Consistent back button behavior and placement
- Standard title placement and formatting

[WIREFRAME_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./WIREFRAME_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for
comprehensive details on design consistency.

   - Comprehensive rule logic inspector and builder
   - Advanced validation simulator with real-time feedback
   - AI-powered relationship suggestions and anomaly detection

   - AI-powered validation with pattern recognition

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 2 prototype development based on enhanced wireframes
2. Implement key UI components for complex visualizations
3. Develop rule engine infrastructure for validation system
4. Create workflow orchestration system for approval processes
5. Begin component implementation with production-ready code

## Implementation Notes

These wireframes are designed to be implemented using:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI primitive components
- React Hook Form for form handling
- tRPC for type-safe API communication
- NextAuth.js for authentication
