# PosalPro MVP2 - Refined Wireframe Designs

## User Story Traceability Integration

### Traceability Documentation

All wireframes now include comprehensive user story traceability with:

- **User Story IDs**: Direct mapping to specific user stories (US-X.X format)
- **Hypothesis Coverage**: Clear link to validation hypotheses (H1, H3, H4, H8)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed mapping to component implementations
- **Testing Scenarios**: Specific test cases for hypothesis validation
  (TC-HX-XXX format)
- **Measurement Instrumentation**: Analytics requirements for performance
  tracking

### Key Traceability Documents

- **[User Story Traceability Matrix](./USER_STORY_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md)**:
  Complete mapping between user stories, wireframes, and test cases
- **[Testing Scenarios Specification](./TESTING_SCENARIOS_SPECIFICATION.md)**:
  Detailed test cases with measurement criteria and success thresholds

### Enhanced Wireframes with Traceability

Each wireframe now includes a dedicated traceability section:

### Implementation Requirements

Each wireframe specifies:

1. **Component Traceability Matrix**: TypeScript interfaces mapping components
   to user stories
2. **Acceptance Criteria Implementation**: Direct mapping of criteria to
   component methods
3. **Measurement Instrumentation**: Analytics hooks and tracking requirements
4. **Success Thresholds**: Specific performance targets for hypothesis
   validation

## Comprehensive Hypothesis Coverage

The enhanced wireframes now provide complete coverage for all key hypotheses:

- **H1 (Content Discovery - 45% search time reduction)**: Content Search Screen
- **H3 (SME Contribution - 50% time reduction)**: SME Contribution Screen
- **H4 (Cross-Department Coordination - 40% effort reduction)**: Coordination
  Hub, Proposal Creation
- **H6 (Requirement Extraction - 30% completeness improvement)**: RFP Parser
  Screen
- **H7 (Deadline Management - 40% on-time improvement)**: Coordination Hub,
  Proposal Creation, Approval Workflow, Executive Review, Dashboard
- **H8 (Technical Validation - 50% error reduction)**: Validation Dashboard
  Screen

### Supporting Infrastructure

Additional wireframes provide supporting functionality:

- **Dashboard Screen**: Central hub with overview metrics for all hypotheses
- **Approval Workflow Screen**: Process orchestration supporting deadline
  management
- **Executive Review Screen**: Decision interface supporting timeline management

This comprehensive traceability system ensures that every user story can be
validated through specific test cases and measured against hypothesis success
criteria during implementation.

## Overview

This directory contains refined layout sketches for PosalPro's core screens,
building upon the low-fidelity wireframes. These designs include actual text
content, improved visual structure, and state handling to provide a clearer
representation of the final UI.

- Touch-friendly target sizes for mobile interactions

## Design Consistency Standards

All wireframes follow these standardized patterns to ensure a cohesive user
experience:

### Button Labeling Convention

- All action buttons use consistent verb-noun format (e.g., "Create Product",
  "Export Data")
- Primary actions: "Create X", "Edit X", "Delete X"
- Secondary actions: "Import Data", "Export Data", "Clone X"
- Form actions: "Save Changes", "Save Draft", "Save and Activate", "Cancel"

### Tab Navigation

- Consistent horizontal tab navigation across screens with similar information
  density
- Standard placement below screen header and above content area
- Active tab indication through visual highlighting and accessibility attributes
- Consistent semantic tab naming across related screens (e.g., "Dashboard",
  "Details", "History")

### Status Indicators

- Consistent placement of status indicators relative to content
- Standardized color coding: success (green), warning (amber), error (red), info
  (blue)
- Status indicators include both color and iconography for accessibility
- Consistent naming conventions for statuses across all screens

### Navigation Patterns

- Left sidebar navigation consistent across all authenticated screens
- Breadcrumb navigation for hierarchical content
- Consistent back button behavior and placement
- Standard title placement and formatting

See [WIREFRAME_CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md](./WIREFRAME_CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md) and
[WIREFRAME_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./WIREFRAME_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for
comprehensive details on design consistency.
