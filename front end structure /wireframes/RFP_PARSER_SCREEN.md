### Mobile Considerations

- **Collapsible Sections**: AI analysis and source text panels collapse to save
  space
- **Simplified Table**: Condensed requirement display with essential information
- **Swipe Actions**: Horizontal swipe to navigate between document,
  requirements, and compliance tabs
- **Progressive Loading**: Requirements load in batches to optimize performance
- **Offline Support**: Downloaded documents remain accessible when offline

## AI-Assisted Features

### Automated Requirement Extraction

The system analyzes RFP documents to:

- Identify explicit requirements (shall, must, will, etc.)
- Detect implicit requirements (desired outcomes, preferences)
- Extract contextual information for each requirement
- Link related requirements across different sections
- Assign confidence scores to extraction accuracy

### Compliance Assessment

AI evaluates requirements against capabilities by:

- Matching requirements to product features and specifications
- Identifying gaps in current offerings
- Calculating compliance scores by section and overall
- Prioritizing requirements by importance and risk
- Suggesting alternative approaches for challenging requirements

### Response Generation

The system assists in creating proposal responses by:

- Drafting initial responses based on past successful proposals
- Integrating product information that addresses specific requirements
- Highlighting strengths and differentiators relevant to each requirement
- Generating explanations for partial compliance areas
- Suggesting win themes and strategic messaging
