# Product Store Archive - 2025-08-25

## Why This File Was Archived

The old product store (`src/lib/store/productStore.ts`) was archived because:

### Comparison with Current Store (`src/stores/productStore.ts`)

| Feature             | Old Store (Archived) | Current Store (Active)               |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Lines of Code**   | 50 lines             | 393 lines                            |
| **Scope**           | UI state only        | Complete data management             |
| **Architecture**    | Basic Zustand        | Zustand + Immer + DevTools           |
| **CRUD Operations** | Limited              | Complete (add, update, remove, bulk) |
| **Performance**     | Basic                | Optimized with shallow comparison    |
| **Pagination**      | None                 | Full infinite scroll support         |
| **Error Handling**  | None                 | Comprehensive error states           |
| **Statistics**      | None                 | Full stats management                |
| **Bulk Operations** | None                 | Bulk delete/update support           |

### Decision Criteria

✅ **Current Store is Better Because:**

1. **More Comprehensive**: Handles both UI state AND data management
2. **Better Performance**: Uses Immer for immutable updates, proper selectors
3. **Complete Feature Set**: Supports all CRUD operations, pagination, bulk
   operations
4. **Production Ready**: Includes error handling, statistics, and debugging
   tools
5. **Already in Use**: All components are already importing from
   `src/stores/productStore.ts`

❌ **Old Store Limitations:**

1. **Limited Scope**: Only managed UI state, not actual product data
2. **No CRUD Operations**: Missing essential product management features
3. **Poor Performance**: No optimization for large datasets
4. **No Error Handling**: Missing error states and recovery
5. **Not Used**: No components were importing this file

### Migration Status

- ✅ **No Migration Needed**: All components already use the better store
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: The old store was not being used
- ✅ **Clean Archive**: Simply moved to archive directory for reference

### Current Usage

All product-related components use:

```typescript
import useProductStore from '@/stores/productStore';
```

This is the correct and recommended approach.
