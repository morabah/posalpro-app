# Unused Bridge Implementations Archive

**Archive Date**: September 8, 2025 **Archive Time**: 11:57 UTC **Reason**:
Bridge implementations identified as unused legacy code

## 📁 Archived Files

### Bridge Components

- `EventBridge.ts` - Event communication bridge for inter-component messaging

## 🔍 Analysis

### Why Archived

- **No Active Usage**: Comprehensive search found no imports or references in
  active application code
- **Legacy Code**: Created during bridge pattern implementation but never
  integrated into main application
- **Modern Architecture**: Application uses direct state management (Zustand)
  instead of event-based communication
- **Zero Dependencies**: No other active components depend on this bridge

### Current Architecture

**Active State Management:**

```typescript
// Modern pattern used throughout the app
import { useGlobalState } from '@/lib/bridges/StateBridge';
import { useUIState } from '@/lib/bridges/StateBridge';
```

**Archived Event Bridge (Unused):**

```typescript
// ❌ OLD: Event-based communication (not used)
import { globalEventBridge } from '@/lib/bridges/EventBridge';
globalEventBridge.emit('USER_LOGIN', userData);
```

## 📋 Verification

### Search Results

- ✅ No imports of `EventBridge` in active code
- ✅ No usage of `useEventBridge` hook in application
- ✅ No references to `globalEventBridge` in components
- ✅ EventBridge only exists in archived files and examples

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Safe to Remove**: This file can be permanently deleted if not needed for
future development.
